This topic opens my understanding on how to arrange data structures and maintain a list in a memory i.e how to maintain a link using a linked list. I exposes me to the types of linked lists and how each of them work.
The prerequisites to this topic are:
User defined data type - struct, typdef
Dynamic Memory allocation - malloc, free
